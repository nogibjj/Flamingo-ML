# ML final project
In this study, we carefully explored the relationship between cryptocurrency returns and human sentiment [1]. Our approach involved integrating established market indicators with sentiment data from various sources, including Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance, news data from the TIINGO News API, Twitter sentiment from Bloomberg, and Google Trends information, following a detailed review of relevant literature. We focused on enhancing the prediction of Bitcoinâ€™s 15-day moving average daily return, a metric chosen for its potential to moderate the market's inherent volatility. Our methodology included the use of four distinct feature sets, each designed to provide different insights into market behaviors. We employed both a foundational linear regression model and a more detailed Random Forest model, rigorously testing each for consistency and stability across diverse data sets. To demonstrate the practical application of our findings, we also conducted a sample trading strategy. This strategy helped confirm the feasibility of using our models in real-world trading scenarios, supporting the credibility of our research while carefully managing claims about its potential impact.
