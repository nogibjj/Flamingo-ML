2021-04-15 13:25:08,33847511.0," round two of big bank earnings looked a lot like round one: a knockout. it?s nice to not only see good earnings, but optimistic views going forward, which is very important this particular reporting season. bank of america corp (nyse: bac) and citigroup inc (nyse: c) both easily topped analysts? expectations with their q1 results, and that?s not all. blackrock, inc. (nyse: blk) and pepsico, inc. (nasdaq: pep) also had upbeat quarters. it?s extremely early, but investors seem to like what they?ve seen so far from reporting companies, and major indices took the high road in pre-market trading thursday after a forgettable performance the day before. there?s nothing forgettable about today?s surging retail sales and decreasing jobless claims. we?ll get to those a bit farther down. more banks, more earnings strength financials continued with really solid results and positive outlooks expressed in their calls this morning. we?re off to a good start in earnings. like other big banks reporting this week, bac had a strong investment banking and trading quarter, with gains in both the equity and fixed income sides of the field. earnings per share of $0.86 easily surpassed wall street analysts? expectations for $0.66, and revenue of $22.9 billion topped the consensus view of $22.1 billion. in the meantime, c posted profit of $7.94 billion, or $3.62 per share, topping analysts? estimate of $2.57. revenue of $19.3 billion came in above the street consensus of $18.8 billion. in a repeat of yesterday?s action, c and bac released billions of dollars from their loan loss reserves, the stash of cash they?d put aside last year for possible loan defaults from the covid crisis. the release of these reserves is adding to banks? q1 profits, even though arguably that?s not organic growth. shares of both companies popped in pre-market trading, so maybe investors are prepared to reward them for their earnings beats, which isn?t always a given around bank reporting season. news of bac planning a $25 billion buyback might be one thing supporting shares this morning. for c, the announcement that it would be streamlining its operations across asia-pacific and emerging markets?pulling out of 13 markets to concentrate on four larger asian banking centers?seems to have drawn some applause in the premarket. what people appear to like is that c is getting more focused. the street likes when a company says, ?here?s what our goals are and we won?t try to be everything to everyone.? that may be true for citigroup, but retail sales this morning arguably did have something for everyone in the market?except bears. they jumped a huge 9.8% in march, so it looks like people are back out there shopping as the economy reopens. keep an eye on consumer discretionary shares to see if they benefit from this data, which compared with analyst expectations of around 5%. if things seem like they couldn?t get more positive this morning, get ready because they did. initial weekly jobless claims of 576,000 were by far the lowest since covid struck, down from 769,000 the previous week and expectations of 695,000. it?s just one week of data, but it is very encouraging and appears to show the recovery gaining steam. meanwhile, volatility keeps getting beaten up, with the cboe volatility index (vix) remaining below 17 this morning. it?s amazing how little volatility there is in these markets, though it makes some sense considering many stock indices are at all-time highs. overall, as much as the hand-wringing goes on, the market is saying things look pretty good and now earnings are backing that up. bank leaders sound optimistic of the three big banks that reported yesterday, goldman sachs group inc (nyse: gs) and wells fargo & co (nyse: wfc) ended up with nice gains, but jp morgan chase & co. (nyse: jpm) shares never got above the water line. though earnings and revenue came in above expectations for all three, one impediment for jpm could have been that a decent portion of its earnings beat came from the company?s decision to pull back cash it had set aside for possible loan defaults. not that it wouldn?t have beaten pretty handily even without any help, but maybe that took away some of the fizz. wfc also benefited from pulling back loan reserves, but it was good to see the stock move solidly higher considering all the regulatory pressure they?ve been under the last few years. investors seemed cheered by wfc?s earnings call, with the stock making more gains as the call took place. wfc executives sounded optimistic about both the consumer and corporate business outlooks, and that?s the bread and butter for wfc, considering they don?t have the same kind of exposure to wall street trading as many of the other big banks. the executives at wfc weren?t the only bank leaders sounding optimistic about the economy yesterday. same goes for jpm and gs, but that?s not too surprising considering all the positive remarks we?ve heard from industry leaders the last few weeks. if there?s something that might make people worry, it?s wondering how much the big banks can improve on q1 numbers, especially when it comes to trading and investment banking. they?ve set a pretty high bar for themselves that?s going to mean some tough comparisons down the road. besides the banks and reopening sectors like energy, entertainment, and hotels (which may have gotten some of their tailwind from the banks? positive outlooks for the economy), there wasn?t really any driving force in the market yesterday. earlier this week, big tech had set the pace, but most of those stocks, including monday and tuesday stalwarts tesla inc (nasdaq: tsla) and nvidia corporation (nasdaq: nvda), couldn?t follow through wednesday. that left kind of a leadership vacuum as the nasdaq (comp) tumbled about 1%, even though the dow jones industrial average ($dji) and the russell 2000 index (rut) both received some support from the financial rally. you can?t blame the 10-year treasury yield for the poor tech performance yesterday, with that closely watched metric staying near recent levels in the 1.63% range before dipping briefly below 1.6% this morning. that?s not a number that?s likely to scare anyone, but tech weakness might have just reflected a bit of a swing back toward the ?value? sectors after a strong start this week for tech and other growth areas. the growth vs. value pendulum keeps swinging. gold continued to edge lower this week even though the dollar is also struggling, which is a bit of a head scratcher. typically those two move in different directions. a weaker dollar, if that?s what we?re seeing here, could be bullish for stocks, especially multinationals that do a lot of their business overseas. however, it?s hard to see a lot of softness developing in the dollar if u.s. data and earnings keep looking solid. on another note, yesterday saw coinbase global inc (nasdaq: coin) shares begin trading after their direct public offering (dpo) on nasdaq. coin operates an online exchange where buyers and sellers can meet to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. the debut drew a lot of interest, and the company finished wednesday with a valuation of around $86 billion. the exciting part about cryptocurrencies is watching over the next 10 to 20 years to see how they develop. there are still questions about ease of use and government regulations around these products, but for right now many investors are very excited about them. crude comeback if you?re looking for rallies, check what crude did yesterday. remember, crude tends to get volatile around tuesday and wednesday every week when supply numbers come out. the u.s. price has been vacillating around the $60 per barrel mark for weeks, but seemed to break out of that wednesday on a big draw of u.s. stockpiles, as my td ameritrade network* colleague kevin hincks, senior equity strategist, said yesterday. now we?re clearly through $60, so we?ll see if that level continues to hold. crude prices now aren?t really at levels that would necessarily get anyone nervous about margins for transport companies, but any sign of a move up toward $70 might get people worried.

2021-04-15 14:13:51,33848766.0," what happened: coinbase global inc (nasdaq: coin) closed its first day of trading as a public company at a valuation of $85.7 billion. the crypto exchange?s massive valuation eclipsed all other direct listings, including roblox corp (nyse: rblx), spotify technology sa (nyse: spot), and palantir technologies inc (nyse: pltr), becoming the largest direct listing to date. why it matters: while this was surely a monumental moment for the entire crypto industry, the company, which was launched out of a two-bedroom apartment, is an all-around success story. apart from coinbase?s founders and internal stakeholders, the key beneficiaries of this success story were the company?s earliest investors, with some making 8000 times their initial investment. garry tan, the founder of initialized capital, invested $300,000 in coinbase in early 2013 for a price of $0.15 per share. that investment is now worth $2.4 billion, and tan describes it as his ?best startup investment yet.? fred wilson?s union square ventures invested in the crypto exchange at a price of $0.20 per share, turning their $5 million initial investment to around $12 billion, assuming they did not sell any shares along the way. see also: how to buy coinbase ipo (coin) stock venture firm andreessen horowitz, or a16z, invested in coinbase at $1.00 per share. their return from this one investment surpassed all their other funds combined. what else: coinbase?s success was largely dependent on a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency. according to co-founder fred ehrsam, the road wasn?t always clear. ?there was serious hardship. in the 3 years between 2014 and 2017, the outside world thought crypto was dead. over a third of employees left,? he said on twitter. the exchange?s successful listing has now paved the way for more crypto exchanges to follow. ?coinbase?s ipo will be a reference for crypto.com?s own valuation as the first publicly traded comparable,? said crypto exchange crypto.com in a statement. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzingacoinbase ipo is the end of the beginning for crypto: chainalysis chieffirst 'inverse bitcoin etf' launches on toronto stock exchange? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved."

2021-04-19 15:41:33,33922525.0," (bloomberg) -- while cryptocurrency exchange coinbase global inc.?s direct listing was undeniably a watershed moment for bitcoin, this weekend delivered a harsh refresher on one of the market?s basic tenets: retail traders are running the show.a false report from an anonymous twitter account that the u.s. treasury was cracking down on crypto money laundering was enough to help send bitcoin plunging by as much as 15% on sunday, days after clocking in at a record of $64,870. while low weekend liquidity likely exacerbated the nose dive, the world?s largest cryptocurrency dropped another 3.5% on monday.that an erroneous tweet can torpedo prices is a reminder that even for all the talk of wall street?s growing embrace of crypto, individual investors have a lot of heft to throw around. that dynamic is especially prevalent on weekends, when traditional trading desks go dark while bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to change hands. even as coinbase?s direct listing marks an important milestone for crypto, for institutions and traders venturing into crypto, learning to live with that volatility is a key first step.?it?s more an introduction to all the people who had gotten into bitcoin or crypto over the last week because of coinbase that crypto markets can be very volatile,? philip gradwell, chief economist at crypto data tracker chainalysis, said by phone. ?this is in some sense, nothing new if you?ve been in the industry for a few years.?even by crypto standards, sentiment was looking stretched at the end of last week. bitcoin soared in the lead up to coinbase?s much-anticipated listing, bringing year-to-date gains to over 118% at one point. that enthusiasm spilled into so-called altcoins such as dogecoin, which has soared more than 13,000% over the past year.the moves can be jarring. roughly $9.3 billion in so-called long bitcoin future positions were liquidated on saturday, followed by another $700 million on sunday, according to data from bybt.com.such a pullback in bitcoin was ?inevitable? given the degree of froth, galaxy digital founder michael novogratz tweeted over the weekend, adding that ?we will be fine in the medium term? as institutions enter the space.to mike mcglone, a bloomberg intelligence commodity strategist, the recent run-up in dogecoin is exemplary of retail?s involvement in crypto markets. his plumber told him recently that he?d bought the joke coin. to mcglone, it?s a result of the ?perfect storm? of pandemic lock-ups, lots of cash in the system, and investors? ability to speculate around the clock.?markets will never change -- this one is just 24/7 and the easiest to access in history,? he said. it?s ?a prime example of just plain gambling for fun -- unless participants lose too much money, notably because they took too much risk at the casino.?shifting the power dynamic in favor of the institutions will be the ?holy grail? for coinbase, bi analyst julie chariell said last week, given that corporations are less likely to dump their holdings as quickly as retail traders. though individual investors made up just 36% of the exchange?s volume during the quarter ending dec. 31, more than 90% of coinbase?s revenue came from retail trades.whether the cryptocurrency exchange is successful remains to be seen. but even should bitcoin carve out a place in portfolios and on corporate balance sheets beyond the likes of microstrategy inc. and tesla inc., the weekend will likely still belong to the individual investor.?the retail investor still dominates the crypto market,? steven mcclurg, cio at valkyrie investments, said in a phone interview. ?when you see action like that over the weekend, that?s just when all the institutional traders are asleep or not working.?for more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comsubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.?2021 bloomberg l.p."

2021-04-20 19:56:54,33958843.0," cathie wood, the founder of ark invest, is taking wall street by storm with her unconventional thematic investing. namely, she follows an innovative fund style to find hyper-growth stocks with game-changing technology. certainly, her unique method is working. to be sure, five out of six ark etfs posted more than 100% returns in last year alone. result? her funds saw a massive inflow of $20.6 billion, according to data from morningstar, portfolio insider, and nasdaq. recently, wall street saw a heavy rotation into value stocks. but don?t count cathie wood as one of them. instead, she is doubling down her bets on these innovative companies. ?the benchmarks are filling up with value traps? due to the pace of innovation in fields including artificial intelligence and robotics, wood said. ?we think the big risk is in the benchmarks, not what we?re doing.? billionaire cathie wood's predictions are must-follow because of her historic returns in the last three years -- with her picks soaring many times above their original share prices. case in point: last year, ms. wood?s ark genomic revolution etf, ark innovation etf, and ark next generation internet etf reaped returns of 159%, 203%, and 157%, respectively. now, here are four technology stocks with huge potential that cathie wood has bought for her funds: 1. coinbase (nasdaq: coin) surely, cathie wood is bullish on cryptocurrency. she has been buying hand over fist in the largest cryptocurrency exchange and digital wallet service provider coinbase. on the day when coinbase made its public debut, ark invest scooped up 749,205 shares. a few days later, it added another 340,273 shares (worth nearly $112,970,000 million) to its position. never shy from making bold predictions, wood believes that digital wallets can develop into the most valuable technology of this era, pointing out its unprecedented speed of organic growth. ""digital wallets could become the most valuable technology developments per user of almost anything. we're pretty excited about that. if you were to draw a graph as we did in our big ideas showing how jpmorgan chase & co. (nyse: jpm) got to these levels, it was one acquisition after the other, whereas cash app and venmo, because they are viral in nature, have gotten there organically,"" cathie wood said. recent reports have supported wood?s prediction. the digital wallet payments have surpassed the physical card for usage at contactless in-store payments and at the point-of-sale (pos) in 2020, according to the global payments report. plus, in-store cash payments fell by at least 50% in 2020 in advanced economies. 2. unity software (nyse: u) a real-time 3d development platform unity software is trading at a bargain-basement price, in cathie wood?s view. she has been boosting her unity software stake over the last two months as the stock fell by 34% year to date. despite the recent selloff, the company?s future fundamentals look strong based on revenue growth projections. unity software expects 2021 revenue in the range of $950 million to $970 million, in line with the company?s plan of sustaining 30% revenue growth in the long run. unity ceo john riccitiello said: ?as the leader in creating and operating tools for the world of real-time 3d content, we continue to invest with the intent to capture what we believe is a substantial opportunity ahead in 2021 and years beyond.? 3. shopify (nyse: shop) wood believes that shopify can be as big as online retail giant amazon (nasdaq: amzn) someday. as a result, cathie wood saw the dip in shopify stock as a buying opportunity. her firm added to its existing stake in e-commerce platform last week, according to portfolio insider. ""we're trying to figure out how amazon is going to deal with this notion of individuals seeing something on instagram or elsewhere on facebook or on twitter, or on snap and just buying there,"" wood said. ""that's a shopify-enabled commerce opportunity and we think it's going to be big."" recently, shopify?s stock price pulled back slightly from its recent all-time high of $1,500 that it had hit early in february. regardless of the short-term price movements, shop?s stock price upside is likely to be tightly wounded to its growth trends. so far, so good: shopify?s fourth-quarter revenue jumped 94% while 2020 revenue surged 86%. 4. sea limited (nyse: se) cathie wood has also been on a shopping spree with sea limited this year. the biggest lure of sea limited is how they can integrate dozens of their businesses into each other. sea limited has tentacles in esports, mobile gaming, e-commerce, digital payments, and food delivery services. and the company is aggressively expanding its market penetration outside its home country in china, especially in latin america and southeast asia. these segments have generated triple-digit revenue growth for sea limited. as a result, its consolidated revenue grew more than 100% in 2020, and it expects to extend that momentum into 2021. cathie wood first initiated a position in sea limited during the final quarter of 2019, and she has only continued to add her stake over time. see more from benzingaclick here for options trades from benzinga84% of warren buffett's portfolio in 2021 is in these 3 categories? 2021 benzinga.com. benzinga does not provide investment advice. all rights reserved."
